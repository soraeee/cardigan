			<p className="about-header">About</p>
			<p className="about-text">Cardigan is a webapp for running card draws using various ITG tournament packs.</p>
			<p className="about-text">Originally created for <a className="link" href="https://rip.ddrillini.club/" target="_blank">Rumble in the Prairie 13.5</a>, Cardigan now supports a variety of ITG tournaments and plans to support more upon request.</p>
			<br />

			<p className="about-header">Usage</p>
			<p className="about-text">Use the fields in the header to define the constraints for the card draw.</p>
			<p className="about-text">Press Draw to draw a set of charts. Press Clear to set up the pool for the next set of players. Press Reset to clear everything, and return all charts into the available pool.</p>
			<p className="about-text">Dupe protection will prevent a chart from showing up in future draws once it has been drawn once, until all charts in the available pool have been drawn.</p>
			<p className="about-text">If dupe protection is on, pressing Reset will also restore all previously drawn charts into the pool to be drawn again.</p>
			<br />
			<p className="about-text">After drawing, click on a card to show options for that card.</p>
			<p className="about-text">Protect and Veto will display markers for that card to signify who has protected or vetoed that chart.</p>
			<p className="about-text">Reset will remove any protect or veto markers.</p>
			<p className="about-text">Redraw will draw a new chart from the available pool of charts and replace the current chart.</p>
			<br />

			<p className="about-header">FAQ</p>
			<p className="about-question">Why make a new website for card draws? Doesn't <a className="link" href="http://ddr.tools/" target="_blank">DDRTools</a> already exist?</p>
			<p className="about-text">When making this webapp for RIP13.5, we needed something that supported draws with dupe protection.</p>
			<p className="about-text">The reasonable solution here would have been to contact the maintainer of DDRTools and ask him to implement dupe protection, but it's more fun to build a new app from scratch instead of being reasonable.</p>
			<p className="about-text">(also sorae really needed practice with React)</p>
			<p className="about-text">Either way, please support DDRTools as well! We don't intend to compete with their project.</p>
			<br />

			<p className="about-question">Can I fork this project for my own tournament using my own pack?</p>
			<p className="about-text">Sure, feel free to fork!</p>
			<p className="about-text">If you use <a className="link" href="https://github.com/soraeee/sm2json" target="_blank">sm2json</a> and replace the banner images and the pack.json in this project, you should be able to get a working version with your own pack.</p>
			<p className="about-text">Ideally, this app will be maintained with the latest version of the RIP Singles Pack, or will have an option to select between different packs later.</p>
			<br />

			<p className="about-question">Where do I go to report bugs, suggest things for the project, or ask any general questions?</p>
			<p className="about-text">Follow the GitHub link in the footer, and open an issue (or a pull request if you've got some code)!</p>
			<p className="about-text">sorae and CERiNG can be contacted through Discord via the same handles.</p>
